Final Year Research Project

 # Project Name
 SMART AQUIRUM MONITORING SYSTEM

## Description
Ensuring optimal conditions for fish is vital for their health, breeding success, and overall well-being.

Current practices in aquarium management rely heavily on manual observation and adjustments, leading to inconsistencies and inaccuracies in maintaining water quality and feeding schedules.

Poor water quality, irregular feeding, and undetected behavioral issues can lead to stress, disease, and reduced breeding success.

Enthusiasts and breeders struggle to provide tailored environments without precise automated systems. 

The absence of integrated monitoring solutions makes it challenging to correlate environmental factors with fish health and behavior.

This project develops an intelligent system using sensors, machine learning, and computer vision to enhance aquarium management and promote fish well-being.

## Features
- Feature 1

 Aquarium caretakers encounter these challenges when seeking to monitor and maintain optimal conditions for aquatic life within the aquarium. By implementing smart monitoring systems, they gain valuable insights into water parameters, enabling prompt intervention when issues arise to ensure the health and safety of the aquatic inhabitants.

These systems also extend to commercial fish breeding, providing valuable support in maintaining optimal conditions for breeding and rearing fish.


- Feature 2

In the Smart Aquarium System,  focuses on fish disease detection, treatment suggestion, and recovery monitoring.

 Through the cam we capture the fish to predict diseases..

The system identifies the disease type, provides detailed information, suggests treatments, and specifies a monitoring period.

Monitoring through cameras, tracking recovery post-treatment
